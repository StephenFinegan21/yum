## Classic Margherita Pizza Recipe

### Ingredients

- Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Fresh basil leaves
- Olive oil
- Salt

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature, usually around 475-500 degrees F (245-260 degrees C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.

2. On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness.

3. Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

4. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.

5. Tear fresh basil leaves and scatter them over the top of the cheese.

6. Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza and add a pinch of salt.

7. Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (on the pizza stone if you have one) and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbly.

8. Remove from oven, let cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.
