## Quick and Easy Pancake Recipe

### Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 large egg

### Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

2. Add milk, melted butter, and egg; whisk until just combined. The batter should have small to medium lumps.

3. Preheat your skillet over medium heat and brush with 1 1/2 teaspoons butter or oil.

4. For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto the skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread the batter into a round shape.

5. Cook until the surface of the pancakes has some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes.

6. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.

7. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in the oven.

8. Continue with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. Serve warm.
